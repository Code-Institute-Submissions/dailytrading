Daily Trading

As a former Forex trader I have always struggled to find a platform that truly helped me start and learn how to trade and the study material are all scattered through different platforms and institutions with a lot of miss information and sources prioritizing their own financial profits over educational value. My website covers signals for trades and a platform for traders to communicate and share their ideas while they can study a solid strategy to trade. 

UX

Those who are entering the market as beginners can study in detail and see the action live on forex charts while their chosen mentor is streaming live and they can easily communicate.

Features

-sign/login: Users can create an account to save their process or messages and their shared ideas.

-study content: users will be linked to a website to start learning about the essential basics.

-contact us: through email and social media our users can reach us.

Features Left to Implement

-signal services: here users who start trading can use the signals to profit from the market while they are mastering the techniques.

-mentorship program: users can choose their mentor and join their webinars and studying material. 

-live stream: registered users will be able to see live market breakdowns.

-Q&A: questions and answers in a forum format.

-Ideas platform: Users can share their ideas and post pictures of their charts only and their analysis and other users will be able to rate and comment.
